The issue was that cache invalidation of application configuration didn&amp;rsquo;t work as expected.
If a configuration value was updated, the clients kept using an old value, served by a cached version of the configuration file.
This task was among the oldest ones in our backlog.
When the issue first was discovered, a temporary fix was applied, by renaming the configuration file itself.
After that, the task of actually resolving the problem has just been hanging around in the backlog for a very long time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
