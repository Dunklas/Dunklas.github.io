In this post, I will continue and explain some properties that a function may or may not fulfill.
One-to-one Consider a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined as $f(x) = x^2$. Note that $f$ can have an output value which has two different inverse images, e.g. $f(-3) = f(3) = 9$, but $-3 \ne 3$. This fact means that $f$ does not satisfy the property of being one-to-one, or injective.</description></item><item><title>Terminology of functions</title><link>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/functions_terminology/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/functions_terminology/</guid><description>In my job as a software developer I work with functions everyday, however I don&amp;rsquo;t really have much experience with functions in a mathematical context. My aim with this post is to cover some terminology of functions in a mathematical context.
A function is a process that relates a value in some set to a single value in some set. For example, suppose that $S$ is the set of all strings.</description></item></channel></rss>
