&lt;p>Consider a scenario where, for the rest of your life, from the total of nineteen studio albums by Black Sabbath, you&amp;rsquo;re only allowed to listen to five of them. Without any restrictions to the selection, we can use 5-combinations to ascertain that the number of combinations you&amp;rsquo;d need to consider are:
$${19 \choose 5} = \frac{19!}{5!(19-5)!} = \frac{19!}{5!14!} = 11628$$
When adding some restrictions to the selection, we need to think a bit differently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Combinations</title><link>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/combinations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/combinations/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the area of combinatorics both combinations and permutations are central concepts.

&lt;h2 id="definition">Definition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Combinations&lt;/strong> are &lt;em>unordered&lt;/em> selections of elements from a set. Consider the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$. If we want to select a combination of three elements from $X$, there is only one distinct selection that can be made. $$(a, b, c)$$
If the elements are selected in a different order, it&amp;rsquo;d be the same combination, $(a, b, c) = (b, c, a)$.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Counting number of elements in sets</title><link>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/counting_elements_sets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/counting_elements_sets/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some counting problems can be solved by counting the number of elements in the result of a set operation, such as a union, difference or intersection. In below notes, the notation of $|A|$ is used for the number of elements (i.e. the cardinality ) of a set $A$.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-addition-rule">The addition rule&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The addition rule can be used for counting the number of elements in a union of mutually disjoint sets (mutually disjoint means that the sets have no elements in common).
Suppose a finite set $A$ equals the union of $k$ distinct mutually disjoint subsets $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$, then
$$|A| = |A_1| + |A_2| + \ldots + |A_n|$$&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Permutations</title><link>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/permutations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/permutations/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the area of combinatorics both combinations and permutations are central concepts.

&lt;p>In contrast to combinations, &lt;strong>permutations&lt;/strong> are &lt;em>ordered&lt;/em> selections of elements from a set. Consider the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$. The set has three elements and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to order them in six different ways. These are the permutations of $X$.
$$(a, b, c), (a, c, b), (b, a, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b), (c, b, a)$$&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
