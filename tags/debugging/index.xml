The issue was that cache invalidation of application configuration didn&amp;rsquo;t work as expected. If a configuration value was updated, the clients kept using an old value, served by a cached version of the configuration file. This task was among the oldest ones in our backlog. When the issue first was discovered, a temporary fix was applied, by renaming the configuration file itself.</description></item></channel></rss>
