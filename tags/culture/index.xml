You might have a vague understanding of what you&amp;rsquo;re about to accomplish. Aimlessly traversing the code base, hoping to find places that you might need to change. You instantly start to chase new ideas, while forgetting about prior (and possibly important) ideas. It might be hard to determine when you&amp;rsquo;re done. You might not commit intermediary working states, and have a hard time finding what you&amp;rsquo;ve messed up once something is broken.</description></item></channel></rss>
