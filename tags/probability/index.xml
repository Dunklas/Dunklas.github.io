However, the post only considered the probability of a single event. What if we want to know the probability of two events?
Independent events Imagine (again) that you&amp;rsquo;re to randomly pick a studio album by Black Sabbath, where it&amp;rsquo;s equally likely that you pick any of the studio albums. But this time, consider a scenario where you&amp;rsquo;re to pick two studio albums.</description></item><item><title>Foundations of probability, and expected value</title><link>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/probability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/probability/</guid><description>The idea of probability is to quantify how likely it is for some event to occur in some process or experiment. First, some definitions - The set of all possible outcomes in a process or experiment is refered to as a sample space, while an event is a subset of the sample space (i.e. one or more of the possible outcomes).
Given that $S$ is a finite sample space with equally likely outcomes, and that $E$ is an event in $S$, the probability of $E$, denoted $P(E)$ is defined as the number of desired outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.</description></item></channel></rss>
