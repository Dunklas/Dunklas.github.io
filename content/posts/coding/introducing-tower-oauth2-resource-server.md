The last few months I have delved into the art of writing a REST API using rust.
Specifically, I've used the [axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum) to do so.
At one point, it was time to add authorization.
My case was simple.
I use auth0 as an identity provider, and wanted to ensure that each request provided a JWT issued by a specific auth0 client.

At the time, I was working extensively with Java and Spring in my daily job.
In that ecosystem, I had used spring-security-oauth2-resource-server for a similar use case.
That library makes things easyâ€”you simply specify an issuer URL, and it takes care of discovering JWKS, handling key rotation, and validating JWTs.
However, in Rust, I couldn't find an equivalent library that provided the same level of simplicity.
So, I decided to build one myself.

# What does the middleware do
Authorization!
Lookup well-known/oidc-configuration

Inspired by Spring security oauth2 resource server.

# Example usage
```rust
let auth = <OAuth2ResourceServer>::builder()
        .audiences(&["https://my-resource-server.com"])
        .issuer_url("https://some-identity-provider.com")
        .build()
        .await
        .unwrap();

    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(root))
        .layer(ServiceBuilder::new().layer(auth.into_layer()));

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:3000").await.unwrap();
    axum::serve(listener, app)
        .await
        .unwrap()
```
