Every software developer should keep a diary.

Personally I've kept one for about a year now, and I'm very content.
During some periods I haven't bothered, and that's OK.
You can always write a new entry tomorrow, or next week.

The diary can cover a lot of different aspects from your daily work.
Below are some examples.

 - Things you've learned
 - Accomplishments that you're proud of
 - Thougts on dynamics within your team
 - Sketches of ideas
 - Reasoning behind technical decisions
 - Solutions to problems that you've struggled with

Why? Argument for the why!
Some note on periods when you can't be bothered

Thanks for reading!

What?
 - Reflection
   - Learnings
   - Accomplishments
   - Team dynamics
 - Practical
   - Solutions to problems
   - Reasoning behind technical decisions
 - Random insights
   - Interesting chapter in book
 - Personal knowledgebase (searchable)
 - From pragmatic programmer:
   - Sketches of ideas
   - Readings from meters
   - What they did
   - Things they learned
   - Meeting notes
   - What we're working on
   - Variable values when debugging
   - Reminders of where we put things
   - Record wild ideas
   - Sometimes just doodle

Why?
 - By reflecting over your daily work you will:
   - Identify improvements for you or your team
   - Feel that you're actually growing, learning things (by highlighting them)
 - Persistence
   - You probably reflect already, but your brain might not be the most suitable storage option
   - By writing it, you'll have a personal knowledge base
 - From pragmatic programmer:
   - More reliable than memory
   - Place to store ideas that aren't immediately relevant to the task at hand
   - Acts as a rubber duck (almost like talking to someone, chance to reflect)

Pragmatic Programmer advocates pen and paper. Something special with the act of writing.

Tooling?
 - I use notion
 - https://obsidian.md/ also seems like a nice option

**Final thoughts**
Not bothering to do it daily? Do it weekly!
Forgot to do it for awhile? No worries, today is a new day
