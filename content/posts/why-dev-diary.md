Some introduction...

What?
 - Reflection
   - Learnings
   - Accomplishments
   - Team dynamics
 - Practical
   - Solutions to problems
   - Reasoning behind technical decisions
 - Random insights
   - Interesting chapter in book
 - Personal knowledgebase (searchable)

Why?
 - By reflecting over your daily work you will:
   - Identify improvements for you or your team
   - Feel that you're actually growing, learning things (by highlighting them)
 - Persistence
   - You probably reflect already, but your brain might not be the most suitable storage option
   - By writing it, you'll have a personal knowledge base

Tooling?
 - I use notion
 - https://obsidian.md/ also seems like a nice option

**Final thoughts**
Not bothering to do it daily? Do it weekly!
Forgot to do it for awhile? No worries, today is a new day
