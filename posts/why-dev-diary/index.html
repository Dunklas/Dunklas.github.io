You will think about things that works less well and identify improvements for both yourself and your team.
Sometimes we feel that we&rsquo;re just standing still, not developing as individuals.
By reflecting on accomplishments and things you&rsquo;ve learned you can more clearly see that you&rsquo;re actually growing as an individual, every day.
You might reflect a lot already without writing anything about it.
That&rsquo;s great, but your brain might not be the most suitable storage solution in the long-term.
Additionally, when writing thoughts or solutions related to different problems, you&rsquo;ll get a personal knowledge base.
If you encounter the same issue again, you can always re-visit your old diary entries.</p><p>So, my recommendation to you is to start write a diary.</p><p>Choose whatever format that works best for you; pen and paper or some service/tool such as <a href=https://notion.com/>Notion</a> or <a href=https://obsidian.md/>Obsidian</a>.
If you can&rsquo;t be bothered to write every day, do it weekly instead.
If you forget about it for some time, don&rsquo;t give up!
Write a new entry tomorrow instead.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
