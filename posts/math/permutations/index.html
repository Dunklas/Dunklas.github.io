In this post, I cover some fundamentals of what permutations are and how to count the number of permutations of sets.</p><h2 id=definition>Definition</h2><p>In contrast to combinations, <strong>permutations</strong> are <em>ordered</em> selections of elements from a set. Consider the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$. The set has three elements and it&rsquo;s possible to order them in six different ways. These are the permutations of $X$.
$$(a, b, c), (a, c, b), (b, a, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b), (c, b, a)$$</p><p>What if we only want a selection of 2 elements from $X$? Then it&rsquo;s also possible to order the two elements in six different ways.
$$(a, b), (a, c), (b, a), (b, c), (c, a), (c, b)$$
This is usually refered to an $r$-permutation, and means an <em>ordered</em> selection of $r$ elements from a set. Above are the $2$-permutations of $X$.</p><p>A variation of $r$-permutations is to allow repetition. With repetition allowed there are nine $2$-permutations of $X$.
$$(a, a), (a, b), (a, c), (b, a), (b, b), (b, c), (c, a), (c, b), (c, c)$$</p><h2 id=counting-the-number-of-permutations>Counting the number of permutations</h2><p>To calculate the number of $r$-permutations of a set $X$ with $n$ elements, the process of selecting $r$ elements from $X$ can be seen as a $r$-step process.</p><ul><li>Select first element from $X$</li><li>Select second element from $X$</li><li>$\ldots$</li><li>Select $r$&lsquo;th element from $X$</li></ul><h3 id=with-repetition-allowed>With repetition allowed</h3><p>If repetition is allowed there are $n$ elements to chose from in each step. By the multiplication principle, the number of distinct $r$-permutations are:</p><p>$$n \times n \times \cdots \times n = n^r$$</p><p>This is for example useful in probability theory to calculate the number of possible outcomes of some process. Consider a PIN code consisting of four digits with allowed repetition. The selection of a PIN code may be seen as a 4-step process where there are 10 different choices (0-9) for each step. Thus there are $10^4$ possible PIN codes.</p><h3 id=without-repetition>Without repetition</h3><p>If repetition is not allowed, there are $n$ elements to chose from in the first step, $n -1$ elements to chose from in the second step, and $n - r + 1$ elements to chose from in the last step.</p><p>Given that $n$ and $r$ are integers with $1 \le r \le n$, the number of $r$-permutations (without repetition) are denoted $P(n,r)$ and is given by the below formula.</p><p>$$P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-r+1)\cancel{(n-r)\cdots3\cdot2\cdot1}}{\cancel{(n-r)(n-r-1)\cdots3\cdot2\cdot1}}$$</p><p>Note that for the number of <em>permutations</em> ($r = n$) there are $n - r + 1 = 1$ elements to chose from in the last step. Therefore the number of permutations may be simplified to $n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1 = n!$.</p><p>The number of permutations without repetition is also useful in probability theory. For example, consider the birthdays of each person in a group of five people. Pretend that it&rsquo;s equally likely to have ones birthday in any of the 365 days of the year. What&rsquo;s the probability that no two people in the group share birthday?</p><p>The set of possible birthdays contain $365$ elements. The total sample space has the same size as the number of $5$-permutations from a set of $365$ elements, with repetition allowed. The number of events where no two people share birthdays is the same as the number of $5$-permutations from a set of $365$ elements, without repetition.</p><p>$$\frac{P(365, 5)}{365^5} \approx 0,97286 \approx 97,3%$$</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
