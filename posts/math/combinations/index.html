In this post, I cover some fundamentals of what combinations are and how to count the number of combinations of sets.</p><h2 id=definition>Definition</h2><p><strong>Combinations</strong> are <em>unordered</em> selections of elements from a set. Consider the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$. If we want to select a combination of three elements from $X$, there is only one distinct selection that can be made. $$(a, b, c)$$
If the elements are selected in a different order, it&rsquo;d be the same combination, $(a, b, c) = (b, c, a)$.</p><p>If we instead select a combination 2 elements from $X$ there are three distinct selections that can be made.
$$(a, b), (a, c), (b, c)$$
Each selection is in general refered to as an $r$-combination, and means an <em>unordered</em> selection of $r$ elements from a set. In essence, an $r$-combination is a subset of size $r$. Above are all $2$-combinations of $X$.</p><p>A variation of $r$-combinations is to allow repetition of values. With repetition allowed there are six $2$-combinations of $X$.
$$(a, a), (a, b), (a, c), (b, b), (b, c), (c, c)$$</p><h2 id=counting-the-number-of-combinations>Counting the number of combinations</h2><p>Note! In this section the concept of <em>permutations</em> is used to explain how to count number of combinations. For a better understanding, please read <a href=https://dunklas.github.io/posts/math/permutations/ title="Introduction to permutations">Introduction to permutations</a> first.</p><h3 id=without-repetition>Without repetition</h3><p>To calculate the number of $r$-combinations of a set $X$ with $n$ elements, it&rsquo;s useful to first think of how the number of $r$-permutations are calculated. The process of constructing an $r$-permutation can be seen as a 2-step process:</p><ul><li>Select a subset of size $r$</li><li>Select an ordering of the subset</li></ul><p>The first step is the same as selecting an $r$-combination. For the second step, the number of possible ways to order the elements in the subset is the same as the number of permutations of the subset, $r!$. In other words, the number of $r$-permutations of $X$ equals the number of $r$-combinations, multiplied by $r!$. Therefore we can calculate the number of $r$-combinations in the following way.
$$\frac{P(n, r)}{r!} = \frac{\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}}{r!} = \frac{n!\times1}{(n-r)!\times r!} = \frac{n!}{r!,(n-r)!}$$
Given that $n$ and $r$ are non-negative integers with $r \le n$, the number of $r$-combinations of a set with $n$ elements is denoted ${n \choose r}$ or $C(n, r)$, and is read &ldquo;chose $r$ over $n$&rdquo;.</p><p>The number of $r$-combinations can be used to solve problems like - There are 19 studio albums by Black Sabbath. For the rest of your life, you can only listen to 3 of them. How many combinations of studio albums do you have to consider? Since the set of studio albums by Black Sabbath has 19 elements, and we need to make a selection of 3 elements, the answer is:
$${19 \choose 3} = \frac{P(19, 3)}{3!} = \frac{19!}{3!,(19-3)!} = \frac{19!}{3!,16!} = \frac{19 \times 18 \times 17 \times \cancel{16!}}{3\times 2 \times 1 \times \cancel{16!}} = \frac{5814}{6} = 969$$</p><h3 id=with-repetition-allowed>With repetition allowed</h3><p>To calculate the number of $r$-combinations with repetition allowed from a set $X$ with $n$ elements, it&rsquo;s useful to imagine $X$ as a set of categories. The objective is to select $r$ elements, where each element belong to a category of $X$, and we are allowed to include multiple elements of the same category. One way to model such a selection is as a string with <strong>x</strong>&rsquo;s representing selected elements and <strong>vertical bars</strong> separating each category.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say that $n = 4$, and $r = 5$ (i.e. we&rsquo;re to select 5 elements from a set of 4 elements).</p><ul><li><strong>xx | x | x | x</strong> - Two elements from category 1, one element from category 2, one element from category 3, and one element from category 4</li><li><strong>xxxxx | | |</strong> - Five elements from category 1, no elements from any of the other categories.</li></ul><p>By this reasoning, an $r$-combination with repetition allowed is modeled as a string of $r$ x&rsquo;s and $n-1$ vertical bars. So, in total the string has $r + n - 1$ symbols. The construction of such a string can be seen as a $r$-step process, where a position for an <strong>x</strong> is selected in each step. The remaining $n -1$ positions can simply be filled with vertical bars. Therefore, the number of $r$-combinations with repetition allowed is given by the number of $r$-combinations from a set of $r + n - 1$ elements.</p><p>$${r + n - 1 \choose r}$$</p><p>An example of a problem that can be solved with $r$-combinations with repetition - A record store is about to stock up with 20 new studio albums by Black Sabbath. They know that <em>Paranoid</em> sells more than other records, so they want <em>at least</em> 10 of those. How many ways can the 20 records be distibuted among the 19 different Black Sabbath studio albums, if the selection must include at least 10 copies of <em>Paranoid</em>?</p><p>Begin by selecting 10 copies of <em>Paranoid</em>. There are now $r = 20 - 10 = 10$ selections left to make from the set of studio albums with $n = 19$ elements. The selection may or may not include more copies of <em>Paranoid</em>.</p><p>$${10 + 19 -1 \choose 10} = {28 \choose 10} = 13123110$$</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
